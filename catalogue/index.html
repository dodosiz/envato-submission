<h2>2. Company (or Business)  Information</h2>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/catalogue-ionic/04-business-info.png">
 Provide information about your business, easily without any code, using Catalogue Ionic unique features:

<h3>2.1 Open Hours</h3>
Let your clients know when your business is open. Set the Open Hours in a configuration file in a matter of seconds and they will be automatically displayed  on the “Contact Us” screen.

<h3>2.2 Contact options</h3>
 Provide your clients with three different contact options:   Phone number, email and business location map.  Just set your phone number, your email address and your location in the configuration file and you are all ready! The Catalogue Ionic will take care of the rest and will make available to the users 3 buttons:
<ul>
<li>Call us: It will make the device to start a call to the phone number you have defined</li>
<li>Send us an Email: Mailer will open with your business’s email already set so as the user won’t need to type it</li>
<li>Map  / Get directions: The map application which is already installed on the device will be launched to show your exact location on the map and the User will be able to get directions to reach your business.(Note: You can set more than one locations in the configuration file) </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Social networks</h2>
Catalogue Ionic app provides four buttons for the most popular social networks; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest. Clients would be able to see your social profile with just one click.

<h2>4. Remote data</h2>
The Product Categories and News listing windows are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON protocol. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application’s configuration file. Images, Galleries, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources. Nevertheless, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.
The same applies for the pins in the live map too. The users are able to add and configure the pin points just by adjusting the remote source.

<h2>4.1 Wordpress / Drupal or JSON News</h2>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/catalogue-ionic/05-news.png">
Display news and announcements about your business/store by using a remote JSON structure or your already existing Wordpress and/or Drupal site. Everything you need for that is already built and no additional code is required.

<h2>5. Push notification</h2>
A full working Push notification example is integrated into the application. It comes also with detailed instructions on how to configure everything in your end and have your application ready to send and receive Push Notifications.

<h2>6. Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h2>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quick since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h2>7. Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture</h2>
Categories and products can be adjusted by just updating their JSON files. They only need to be placed in the related folder and everything else is set up and ready to be used.

Besides, Catalogue Ionic’s modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for the configuration of the rest features too. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier.

You could review this super-modular architecture by checking our SuperModular Ionic starter, which is provided for free.

</ul>

<h2>8. Ionic design</h2>
Catalogue Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own built in icon library which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
